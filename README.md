The repository [@uni_assignments](https://github.com/AlexandruAndrita/uni_assignments "uni_assignments") combines the assignments from the main lecture during this semester: <br/>
 [ 1 ] Machine Learning: Supervised Techniques <br/>
 [ 2 ] Hands-on AI <br/>
 [ 3 ] Programming in Python. <br/>
 
<br/>
[ 1 ] The course is about the machine learning supervised techniques: classification (i.e. methods aiming at models that classify data) or regression (i.e. predict continuous targets from inputs). 
<br/>
[ 2 ] The focus of this course is put on Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning techniques using practical applications in order to get an overview of different approaches. 
<br/>
[ 3 ] The purpose of this course is to reinforce the Python language programming, starting from the basics and then introducing advanced concepts.
