[@python_assignments](https://github.com/AlexandruAndrita/uni_assignments "uni_assignments") combines the assignments from the main lectures during this semester: <br/><br/>
:robot: ```Machine Learning: Supervised Techniques ``` <br/>
The course is about the machine learning supervised techniques: classification (i.e. methods aiming at models that classify data) or regression (i.e. predict continuous targets from inputs). <br/><br/>
:space_invader:```Hands-on AI``` <br/>
The focus of this course is put on Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning techniques using practical applications in order to get an overview of different approaches. <br/><br/>
:snake:```Programming in Python``` <br/>
The purpose of this course is to reinforce the Python language programming, starting from the basics and then introducing advanced concepts.
<br/><br/>
:construction_worker_man:```Algorithms and Data Structures``` <br/>
This topics of this course consits of implementing search trees, hashing, graphs and other data structures. Moreover, basic concepts of optimization using evolutionary and PRAM algorithms will be introduced.
